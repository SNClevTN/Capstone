Executive Summary
While reading the article “The State Of Data, March 2021” I read this quote from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “$4.2 billion reported losses associated with the 791,790 complaints of suspected internet crime the FBI received in 2020, up from 300,000 in 2019.” (FBI) This intrigued me to find out more about the trends of reports from citizens over the years. Have the types of crimes changed, have the age groups changed, and/or have the amounts continue to rise each year? I will use data the FBI has reported throughout the years to find answers to these questions.
	
Motivation
As data and internet dependency rise across the world, I am curious how the scammer industry continues to invade our computers. When we learn from the past, we can continue to fight the good fight to educate users on the scams being used and what to watch out for online.
	
Data Question
How has internet crimes been monetized, tracked, and harmed victims over the past 10 years?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Organize the data and see what format each year has will be the priority to begin the project. Once clean databases have been created, I will be using Tableau to make visualizations to show users who the scammers target, what schemes they are using, and more.

Schedule (through 4/30/2021)
1.	Get the Data (4/8)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (4/18)
3.	Create Presentation of your Analysis (4/26)
4.	Internal demos (4/26/2021)
5.	Clean, add, and tidy up (4/26-4/29)
6.	Demo Day!! (4/30/2021)

PDF’s from FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center: Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | Annual Reports

Known Issues and Challenges
The data is in PDFs with no set format from year to year, web scraping will lead to a large amount of cleaning within Python. Cleaning, organizing, and analyzing the data is going to enforce my skill set of making data usable. Once in Tableau I will be able to tell the story of how internet scammers have change over the years, and what to tell you parents and grandparents to watch out for.
